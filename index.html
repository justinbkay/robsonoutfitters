        <h2>Deer Hunting</h2>
        Deer hunting takes place in the month of October. This is a beautiful time with vivid colors and breathtaking scenery.
        You will see an assortment of big mule deer. We stay in wall tents, with stoves in the tents. You will have three square meals a day and sleep on good cots.

        <h2>Elk Hunting</h2>
        <p>
          There is no better place on earth to find trophy bull elk than the Rocky Mountains of Idaho.  Here in beautiful Teton Valley, ID elk are abundant.
          During the rut you can call in world class bull elk.
        </p>

        <p>
          We operate in Units 62, 62A, 65 & 67
        </p>
        <p>
          Hunting is hard work and takes a lot of physical effort.

          <strong>Archery Elk Hunting</strong>
          <p>
            Hunting is a great experience.  We do the guided archery hunts in September.
          </p>
          <p>
            We stay in wall tents and make it a comfortable camp with good cots. Expect three good meals from our great camp cook.
            You will have a great bugling experience, getting to hear, see and smell a big bull elk. We aim to get you within 40 yards of the bull elk.
          </p>

          <strong>Rifle Hunts</strong>

          <p>
            For the general and the late hunts, we will put you up in the local motel, so you have a warm, comfortable room for the night.
            We hunt by horseback during the day. You can track big bull elk in the snow. This is an exhilarating experience in our national forest.
